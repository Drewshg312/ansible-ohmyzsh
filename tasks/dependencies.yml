# Package module does not provide with_items optimisation (same as yum)
# So it is faster to abstract out package managers via facts:
- name: '[dependencies] Install ohzsh dependencies for non-mac distributions: zsh, git'
  action: "{{ ansible_pkg_mgr }} name={{ item }} state=latest"
  with_items:
    - zsh
    - git
    - bc
  when: ansible_os_family != 'Darwin'
  become: yes  # disable this for MacOS
  tags:
    - ohmyzsh
    - ohmyzsh_dependencies


# MacOS:
- name: '[dependencies] Install powerlevel9k dependencies: bc'
  homebrew: name=bc state=latest
  when:
    - ohmyzsh_powerlevel9k == true
    - ansible_os_family == 'Darwin'
